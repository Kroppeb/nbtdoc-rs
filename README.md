# nbtdoc

nbtdoc is a schema format for describing an NBT format. The format of nbtdocs are a lot like Rust's structs. This library is the "source" library for the format, and any library wishing to parse nbtdocs should use this library as a reference implementation. The specification for the format can be found [here](docs/format.md), and the documentation for traversing and validating with the data can be found [here](docs/validation.md).
